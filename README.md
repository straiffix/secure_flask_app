# Some secure flask app
Some basic flask app with the most secure architecture as I can do. Small project for Information security course. 

# How to run

Just run run.sh script. If you want to make secure HTTPS connection you should create your own certificates(if you don't have them), one for CA and one is signed by this CA. If you don't you should remove this line from run.sh.
